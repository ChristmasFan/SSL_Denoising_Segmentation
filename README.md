# Pseudo-Label Noise Suppression Techniques for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation

This PyTorch repository contains the code for the paper [Pseudo-Label Noise Suppression Techniques for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10426.pdf). The repository contains the source code for the segmentation experiments on Pascal as well as the human pose estimation experiments on LSP. The code for segmentation on Cityscapes will be added soon.
